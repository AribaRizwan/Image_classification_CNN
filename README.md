# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with ANN and CNN

This repository contains code for image classification using both an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of the following 10 classes:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

## Requirements

To run the code, the following packages are required:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries using:
