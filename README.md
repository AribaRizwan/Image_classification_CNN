# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with ANN and CNN

This repository contains code for image classification using both an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.
